        Education has moved and we’re now in the future! Over the past 5 years, We have been in hundreds of homes, sitting down with parents, hearing them share the struggle their children go through and how school seems not to be meeting their children needs, especially a child’s specific need. With rich and averagely rich parents saying the same thing about their children struggles and how they need one on one attention, which no school can provide even if they’ve 5 students in a class, knowing every child learn at different pace and that the routine of “hiding curriculum” which make education passive and test focus require new approach.

        We do this not only by embracing the future of education, which will increasingly draw on virtual learning technologies, but also by equipping our teachers(tutor partners) with the techniques they need to foster a love of learning that extends far beyond the average school classroom. Because we know that teachers who keep learning help build a community of lifelong learners.
